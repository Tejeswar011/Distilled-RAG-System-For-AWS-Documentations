By combining S3 Lifecycle actions to manage an object's complete lifecycle. For
example, suppose that the objects you create have a well-defined lifecycle. Initially,
the objects are frequently accessed for a period of 30 days. Then, objects are
infrequently accessed for up to 90 days. After that, the objects are no longer needed,
so you might choose to archive or delete them.
In this scenario, you can create an S3 Lifecycle rule in which you specify the initial
transition action to S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Standard-IA, or S3 One Zone-IA storage,
another transition action to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage for archiving, and an
expiration action. As you move the objects from one storage class to another, you save
