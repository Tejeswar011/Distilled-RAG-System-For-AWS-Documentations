An AWS principal, user, role, or service principal (e.g.
aws:PrincipalOrgID
)
A set of Classless Inter-Domain Routings (CIDR) blocks, using
aws:SourceIp
.
For more information about CIDR, see
RFC 4632
on the RFC
Editor website.
Note
Bucket policies that grant access conditioned on the
aws:SourceIp
condition
key with very broad IP ranges (for example, 0.0.0.0/1) are evaluated as
"public." This includes values broader than
/8
for IPv4 and
/32
for IPv6 (excluding RFC1918 private ranges). Block
public access will reject these "public" policies and prevent cross-account
access to buckets that are already using these "public" policies.
