S3 vector buckets organize data using vector indexes, which are resources within a bucket that store and organize vector data for efficient similarity search. Each vector index can be configured with specific dimensions, distance metrics (like cosine similarity), and metadata configurations to optimize for your specific use case. For more information, see
