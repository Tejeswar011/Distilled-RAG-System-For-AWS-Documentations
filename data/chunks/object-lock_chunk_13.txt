How deletes work with S3 Object Lock

legal hold and you try to delete an object, Amazon S3 returns one of the following responses, depending on
how you tried to delete the object:
Permanent
DELETE

â If you issued a
permanent
DELETE
request (a request that specifies a version ID), Amazon S3 returns an
Access Denied (
403 Forbidden
) error when you try to delete the object. For more

.
