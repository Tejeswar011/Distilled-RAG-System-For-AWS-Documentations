This policy qualifies as public because of the third statement. With this
policy in place and
RestrictPublicBuckets
enabled, Amazon S3 allows
access only by CloudTrail. Even though statement 2 isn't public, Amazon S3 disables access
by "Account-2." This is because statement 3 renders the entire policy public, so
RestrictPublicBuckets
applies. As a result, Amazon S3 disables
cross-account access, even though the policy delegates access to a specific
account, "Account-2." But if you remove statement 3 from the policy, then the
policy doesn't qualify as public, and
RestrictPublicBuckets
no
longer applies. Thus, "Account-2" regains access to the bucket, even if you
leave
RestrictPublicBuckets
enabled.
