Block public access settings
S3 Block Public Access provides four settings. You can apply these settings in any
combination to individual access points, buckets, or entire AWS accounts. At the organization
level, you can only enable or disable all four settings together using an "all" or
"none" approach - granular control over individual settings is not available. If you
apply a setting to an account, it applies to all buckets and access points that are owned by
that account. Account-level settings automatically inherit from organization policies
