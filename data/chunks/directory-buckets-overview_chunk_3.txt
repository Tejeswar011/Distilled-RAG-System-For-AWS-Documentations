Directory bucket names
A directory bucket name consists of a base name that you provide and a suffix that
contains the ID of the Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone) that your bucket is located in. Directory
bucket names must use the following format and follow the naming rules for directory
buckets:
bucket-base-name
--
zone-id
--x-s3
For example, the following directory bucket name contains the Availability Zone ID
usw2-az1
:
bucket-base-name
--usw2-az1--x-s3

Directory buckets organize data hierarchically into directories as opposed to the flat
sorting structure of general purpose buckets.
