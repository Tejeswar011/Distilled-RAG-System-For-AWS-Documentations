Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift, and Apache Spark. By default, you can create up to 10 table buckets per AWS account per AWS Region
and up to 10,000 tables per table bucket. For more information, see
Working with S3 Tables and table buckets
.
Note
All table buckets and tables are private and can't be made public. These resources can only be accessed by users who are explicitly granted access. To grant access, you can use IAM resource-based policies
for table buckets and tables, and IAM identity-based policies for users and roles. For more information, see
