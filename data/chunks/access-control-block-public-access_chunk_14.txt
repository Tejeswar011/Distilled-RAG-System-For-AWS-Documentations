Note
Access points don't have ACLs associated with them. If you
apply this setting to an access point, it acts as a passthrough to the
underlying bucket. If an access point has this setting enabled, requests
made through the access point behave as though the underlying bucket has
this setting enabled, regardless of whether the bucket actually
has this setting enabled.
BlockPublicPolicy
Setting this option to
TRUE
for a bucket causes Amazon S3 to reject calls to
PutBucketPolicy
if the specified bucket policy
allows public access. Setting this option to
TRUE
for a
bucket also causes Amazon S3 to reject calls to
PutAccessPointPolicy
for all of the bucket's
same-account access points if the specified policy allows public access.
