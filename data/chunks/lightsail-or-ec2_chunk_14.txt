Elastic Beanstalk can run individual Docker containers, multiple containers with Docker Compose,
or deploy to Amazon ECS, a fully managed container orchestration service which manages and scales the
Amazon EC2 instances running containers.
Containers can be self-managed on Amazon EC2, or deployed to a fully managed AWS
container service such as Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, App Runner, Elastic Beanstalk, and Lambda. These services support
both public and private images, more flexible hourly or commit-based billing, and greater
vertical and horizontal scaling capabilities.
