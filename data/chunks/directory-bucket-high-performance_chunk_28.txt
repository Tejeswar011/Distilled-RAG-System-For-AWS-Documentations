Actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service are recorded as events in CloudTrail. Events include actions taken in
the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface, and AWS SDKs and APIs.

CloudFormation
â is a service that helps you model and set
up your AWS resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources
and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS. You create a
template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like Amazon EC2
instances or Amazon RDS DB instances), and CloudFormation takes care of
provisioning and configuring those resources for you. You don't need to
individually create and configure AWS resources and figure out what's
dependent on what; CloudFormation handles that.
