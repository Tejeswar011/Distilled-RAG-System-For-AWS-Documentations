applications is common for most modern application development.
Some choices elevate the amount of management you need to do. For example, some
organizations have skills and resources to run and manage a Kubernetes implementation,
because they invest in strong SRE teams to manage Kubernetes clusters and find value in
the associated skill portability. These teams handle frequent cluster upgrades. For
example, Kubernetes has three major releases a year, and deprecates old versions.
Organization size is a key factor, as smaller organizations might have a more limited
IT team made up of people fulfilling multiple roles, while larger enterprises can support
hundreds of workloads in production at once.
