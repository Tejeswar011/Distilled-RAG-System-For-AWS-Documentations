Manifest
A manifest is an Amazon S3 object that contains the object keys that you want Amazon S3 to act
upon. If you want to create a Batch Operations job, you must supply a manifest. Your
user-generated manifest must contain the bucket name, object key, and optionally, the
object version for each object. If you supply a user-generated manifest, it must be in
the form of an Amazon S3 Inventory report or a CSV file.
You can also have Amazon S3 generate a manifest automatically based on object filter
