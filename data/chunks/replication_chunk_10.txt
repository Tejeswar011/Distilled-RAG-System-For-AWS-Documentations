Aggregate logs into a single bucket
â If you
store logs in multiple buckets or across multiple accounts, you can easily replicate logs
into a single, in-Region bucket. Doing so allows for simpler processing of logs in a
single location.
Configure live replication between production and test
accounts
â If you or your customers have production and test accounts
that use the same data, you can replicate objects between those multiple accounts, while
maintaining object metadata.
Abide by data sovereignty laws
â You might be
required to store multiple copies of your data in separate AWS accounts within a certain
Region. Same-Region Replication can help you automatically replicate critical data when
compliance regulations don't allow the data to leave your country.
