Expiration actions
â These actions define
when objects expire. Amazon S3 deletes expired objects on your behalf. For example, you
might to choose to expire objects after they have been stored for a regulatory
compliance period. For more information, see
Expiring objects

There are potential costs associated with lifecycle expiration only when you
expire objects in a storage class with a minimum storage duration. For more

General purpose buckets
â You can't use a bucket policy to
prevent deletions or transitions by an S3 Lifecycle rule. For example, even if your
bucket policy denies all actions for all principals, your S3 Lifecycle configuration
still functions as normal.
