bucket is public. This behavior occurs because Amazon S3 block public access performs
validation on the existence of actions in addition to evaluating public access. Suppose
that the bucket policy contains an
Action
statement that allows public
access for an action that isn't supported by Amazon S3 (for example,
s3:NotASupportedAction
). In this case, Amazon S3 block public access
evaluates the bucket as public because such a statement could potentially make the
bucket public if the action later becomes supported. In cases where Amazon S3 block public
access and IAM Access Analyzer for S3 differ in their evaluations, we recommend reviewing the bucket
policy and removing any unsupported actions.
