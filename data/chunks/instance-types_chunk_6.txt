Instance performance
Fixed performance instances
Fixed performance instances provide fixed CPU resources. These instances can
deliver and sustain full CPU performance at any time, and for as long as a workload
needs it. If you need consistently high CPU performance for applications such as
video encoding, high volume websites, or HPC applications, we recommend that you
use fixed performance instances.
Burstable performance instances
Burstable performance (
T
) instances provide a baseline level of CPU
performance with the ability to burst above the baseline. The baseline CPU is
designed to meet the needs of the majority of general purpose workloads, such as
