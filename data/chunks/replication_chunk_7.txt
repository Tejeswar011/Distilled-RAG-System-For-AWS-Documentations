Sync buckets, replicate existing objects, and replicate
previously failed or replicated objects
â To sync buckets and
replicate existing objects, use Batch Replication as an on-demand replication action. For
more information about when to use Batch Replication, see

Replicate objects and fail over to a bucket in another
AWS Region
â To keep all metadata and objects in sync across buckets
during data replication, use two-way replication (also known as bi-directional
replication) rules before configuring Amazon S3 Multi-Region Access Point failover controls. Two-way replication
rules help ensure that when data is written to the S3 bucket that traffic fails over to,
that data is then replicated back to the source bucket.
