S3 One Zone-IA
(
ONEZONE_IA
) â Amazon S3 stores the object data in
only one Availability Zone, which makes it less expensive than S3 Standard-IA. However, the
data is not resilient to the physical loss of the Availability Zone resulting from
disasters, such as earthquakes and floods. The S3 One Zone-IA storage class is as durable as
S3 Standard-IA, but it is less available and less resilient. For a comparison of storage
class durability and availability, see
