following:
For storing backups.
For older data that is accessed infrequently, but that still requires millisecond
access. For example, when you upload data, you might choose the S3 Standard storage class,
and use lifecycle configuration to tell Amazon S3 to transition the objects to the
S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA class.
For more information about lifecycle management, see
Managing the lifecycle of objects
.
Note
The S3 Standard-IA and S3 One Zone-IA storage classes are suitable for objects larger than
128 KB that you plan to store for at least 30 days. If an object is less than 128 KB, Amazon S3
charges you for 128 KB. If you delete an object before the end of the 30-day minimum storage
duration period, you are charged for 30 days.
