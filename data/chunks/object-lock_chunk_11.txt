permission, the operation will
succeed.
Legal holds
With Object Lock, you can also place a
legal hold
on an object
version. Like a retention period, a legal hold prevents an object version from being
overwritten or deleted. However, a legal hold doesn't have an associated fixed amount of
time and remains in effect until removed. Legal holds can be freely placed and removed
by any user who has the
s3:PutObjectLegalHold
permission.
Legal holds are independent from retention periods. Placing a legal hold on an object
version doesn't affect the retention mode or retention period for that object version.
