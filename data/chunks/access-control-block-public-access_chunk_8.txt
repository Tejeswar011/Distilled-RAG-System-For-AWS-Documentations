AWS accounts. Amazon S3 doesn't support block public access settings on a
per-object basis.
When you apply block public access settings to an account, the settings apply
to all AWS Regions globally. The settings might not take effect in all Regions
immediately or simultaneously, but they eventually propagate to all
Regions.
When you apply organization-level block public access policies, they
automatically propagate to selected member accounts and override account-level
settings.
