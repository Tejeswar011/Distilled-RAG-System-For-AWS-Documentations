AWS Regions.
Keep data synchronized across Regions during failover
â You can synchronize data in buckets between AWS Regions by configuring two-way
replication rules with S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) directly from a Multi-Region Access Point. To make
an informed decision on when to initiate failover, you can also enable S3 replication
metrics so that you can monitor the replication in Amazon CloudWatch, in S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC), or from the
Multi-Region Access Point.
Make your application highly available
â Even
in the event of a Regional traffic disruption, you can use two-way replication rules to
keep all metadata and objects in sync across buckets during data replication.
