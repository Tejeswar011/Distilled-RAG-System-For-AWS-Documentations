AWS CloudTrail logs
â AWS CloudTrail is an
AWS service that helps you implement operational and risk auditing,
governance, and compliance of your AWS account by recording the actions
taken by a user, role, or an AWS service. For S3 Express One Zone, CloudTrail captures
Regional endpoint API operations (for example,
CreateBucket
and
PutBucketPolicy
) as management events and Zonal API
operations (for example,
GetObject
and
PutObject
)
as data events. These events include actions taken in the AWS Management Console,
AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDKs, and AWS API operations. For more
information, see

Amazon S3 server access logs aren't supported with S3 Express One Zone.
