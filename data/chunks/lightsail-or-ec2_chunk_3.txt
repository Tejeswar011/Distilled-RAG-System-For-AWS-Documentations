Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
â an AWS service that
provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity, with the goal of allowing you to develop,
deploy, and scale applications faster. You can use it to launch as many or as few compute
instances as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. You can also
add capacity by provisioning larger instances (up to hundreds of cores and thousands of GiB
memory) or load balancing clusters of smaller instances. Several different pricing models
are available depending on your requirements.
