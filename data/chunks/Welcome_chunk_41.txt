for 15 minutes after enabling versioning before issuing write operations (PUT or
DELETE requests) on objects in the bucket.
Concurrent applications
This section provides examples of behavior to be expected from Amazon S3 when multiple
clients are writing to the same items.
In this example, both W1 (write 1) and W2 (write 2) finish before the start of R1
(read 1) and R2 (read 2). Because S3 is strongly consistent, R1 and R2 both return
color = ruby
.
In the next example, W2 does not finish before the start of R1. Therefore, R1
might return
color = ruby
or
color = garnet
. However,
because W1 and W2 finish before the start of R2, R2 returns
color =
garnet
.
In the last example, W2 begins before W1 has received an acknowledgment.
