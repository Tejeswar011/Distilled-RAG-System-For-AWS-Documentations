CloudFormation
Amazon EC2 supports creating resources using CloudFormation. You create a template, in JSON or YAML
format, that describes your AWS resources, and CloudFormation provisions and
configures those resources for you. You can reuse your CloudFormation
templates to provision the same resources multiple times, whether in the
same Region and account or in multiple Regions and accounts. For more
information about supported resource types and properties for Amazon EC2, see
EC2 resource type
reference

AWS CloudFormation User Guide
