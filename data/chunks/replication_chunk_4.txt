Replicate objects while retaining metadata
â
You can use replication to make copies of your objects that retain all metadata, such as
the original object creation times and version IDs. This capability is important if you
must ensure that your replica is identical to the source object.
Replicate objects into different storage classes
â You can use replication to directly put objects into S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval,
S3 Glacier Deep Archive, or another storage class in the destination buckets. You
can also replicate your data to the same storage class and use lifecycle configurations on
the destination buckets to move your objects to a colder storage class as they age.
Maintain object copies under different ownership
