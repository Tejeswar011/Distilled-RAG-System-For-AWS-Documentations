When to use two-way replication (bi-directional
replication)
Build shared datasets across multiple AWS Regions
â With replica modification sync, you can easily replicate metadata changes, such
as object access control lists (ACLs), object tags, or object locks, on replication
objects. This two-way replication is important if you want to keep all objects and object
metadata changes in sync. You can
enable replica modification sync
on a new or existing replication rule when
performing two-way replication between two or more buckets in the same or different
AWS Regions.
Keep data synchronized across Regions during failover
â You can synchronize data in buckets between AWS Regions by configuring two-way
