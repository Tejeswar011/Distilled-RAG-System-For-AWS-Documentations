rules help ensure that when data is written to the S3 bucket that traffic fails over to,
that data is then replicated back to the source bucket.
When to use Cross-Region Replication
S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) is used to copy objects across Amazon S3 buckets in different
AWS Regions. CRR can help you do the following:
Meet compliance requirements
â Although Amazon S3
stores your data across multiple geographically distant Availability Zones by default,
compliance requirements might dictate that you store data at even greater distances. To
satisfy these requirements, use Cross-Region Replication to replicate data between distant
AWS Regions.
Minimize latency
â If your customers are in
two geographic locations, you can minimize latency in accessing objects by maintaining
