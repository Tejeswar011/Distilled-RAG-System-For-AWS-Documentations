Zones. When you create a directory bucket to use the S3 Express One Zone storage class, we recommend that you specify an AWS Region and
an Availability Zone that's local to your Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, or Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) compute instances
to optimize performance.
When using S3 Express One Zone, you can interact with your directory bucket in a virtual private cloud (VPC) by
using a gateway VPC endpoint. With a gateway endpoint, you can access S3 Express One Zone
directory buckets from your VPC without an internet gateway or NAT device for your VPC,
and at no additional cost.
You can use many of the same Amazon S3 API operations and features with directory buckets
