Directories
Directory buckets organize data hierarchically into directories as opposed to the flat
sorting structure of general purpose buckets.
With a hierarchical namespace, the delimiter in the object key is important. The only
supported delimiter is a forward slash (
/
). Directories are determined by
delimiter boundaries. For example, the object key
dir1/dir2/file1.txt
results in the directories
dir1
/ and
dir2/
being automatically
created, and the object
file1.txt
being added to the
/dir2
directory in the path
dir1/dir2/file1.txt
.
The directory bucket indexing model returns unsorted results for the
ListObjectsV2
API operation. If you need to limit your results to a
subsection of your bucket, you can specify a subdirectory path in the
prefix
parameter, for example,
prefix=dir1/
.
