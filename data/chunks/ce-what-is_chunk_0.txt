Analyzing your costs and usage with AWS Cost Explorer
AWS Cost Explorer is a tool that enables you to view and analyze your costs and usage. You can
explore your usage and costs using the main graph, the Cost Explorer cost and usage
reports, or the Cost Explorer RI reports. You can view data for up to the last 13 months,
forecast how much you're likely to spend for the next 18 months, and get recommendations for
what Reserved Instances to purchase. You can use Cost Explorer to identify areas that need
further inquiry and see trends that you can use to understand your costs.
