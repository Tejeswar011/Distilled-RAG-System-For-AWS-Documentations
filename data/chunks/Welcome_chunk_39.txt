behavior:
A process writes a new object to Amazon S3 and immediately lists keys within its
bucket. The new object appears in the list.
A process replaces an existing object and immediately tries to read it. Amazon S3
returns the new data.
A process deletes an existing object and immediately tries to read it. Amazon S3
does not return any data because the object has been deleted.
A process deletes an existing object and immediately lists keys within its
bucket. The object does not appear in the listing.
Note
Amazon S3 does not support object locking for concurrent writers. If two PUT
requests are simultaneously made to the same key, the request with the
latest timestamp wins. If this is an issue, you must build an object-locking
mechanism into your application.
