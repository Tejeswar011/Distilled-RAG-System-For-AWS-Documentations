Efficiency:
Use fewer resources than traditional
virtual machines with lightweight containers.
Isolation:
Improve security and reliability with
containers' process-level isolation, with which applications running in separate containers
cannot interfere with each other, improving security and reliability.
Agility:
Reduce the time that it takes to bring new
features or applications to market by quickly packaging and deploying applications.
You can think about the universe of AWS container services in three distinct
layers:
The
Compute capacity layer
is where your containers
actually run. This layer consists of:
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances:
These instances
provide the underlying compute capacity for running containers. You can choose from a
