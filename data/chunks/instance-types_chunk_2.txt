higher share of that resource while it's available.
Each instance type provides higher or lower minimum performance from a shared resource.
For example, instance types with high I/O performance have a larger allocation of shared resources.
Allocating a larger share of shared resources also reduces the variance of I/O performance.
For most applications, moderate I/O performance is more than enough. However, for
applications that require greater or more consistent I/O performance, consider
an instance type with higher I/O performance.
