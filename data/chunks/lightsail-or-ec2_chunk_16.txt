Alternatively, you can choose to share a load balancer across
several Elastic Beanstalk environments. With a shared load
balancer, you save on operational cost by avoiding a dedicated
load balancer for each environment. Elastic Beanstalk supports
the Classic Load Balancer, the Application Load Balancer, and
the Network Application Load Balancer types.
Amazon EC2 Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) offers a broader and more scalable range of load balancer options using more flexible
on demand or commit pricing. Amazon EC2 load balancers support both application (HTTP, HTTPS, WebSockets) and
network (TCP, UDP) traffic.
