Note
When used in a bucket policy, this value can contain a wildcard for the access point name
without rendering the policy public, as long as the account ID is fixed. For
example, allowing access to
arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/*
would
permit access to any access point associated with account
123456789012
in Region
us-west-2
, without rendering the bucket policy
public. This behavior is different for access point policies. For more information,
see
Access points
