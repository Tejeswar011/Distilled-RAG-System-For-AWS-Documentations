Android, and so on). The AWS SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic
access to S3 and AWS. Amazon S3 is a REST service. You can send requests to Amazon S3 using
the AWS SDK libraries, which wrap the underlying Amazon S3 REST API and simplify your
programming tasks. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as calculating
signatures, cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying
requests automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to
download and install them, see

.
Every interaction with Amazon S3 is either authenticated or anonymous. If you are using
the AWS SDKs, the libraries compute the signature for authentication from the keys
that you provide. For more information about how to make requests to Amazon S3, see
