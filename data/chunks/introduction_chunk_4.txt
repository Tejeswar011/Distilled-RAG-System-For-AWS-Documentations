IAM, like many other AWS services, is
eventually consistent
.
IAM achieves high availability by replicating data across multiple servers within
Amazon's data centers around the world. If a request to change some data is successful,
the change is committed and safely stored. However, the change must be replicated across
IAM, which can take some time. Such changes include creating or updating users,
groups, roles, or policies. We recommend that you do not include such IAM changes in the
critical, high-availability code paths of your application. Instead, make IAM changes in
a separate initialization or setup routine that you run less frequently. Also, be sure
to verify that the changes have been propagated before production workflows depend on
them. For more information, see
