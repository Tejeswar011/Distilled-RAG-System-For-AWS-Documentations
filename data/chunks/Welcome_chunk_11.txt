To transform data and trigger workflows to automate a variety of other processing
activities at scale, you can use the following features.
S3 Object Lambda
â Add your own code to S3 GET, HEAD, and LIST requests to modify and process data as
it is returned to an application. Filter rows, dynamically resize images,
redact confidential data, and much more.
Event
notifications
â Trigger workflows that use Amazon Simple Notification Service
(Amazon SNS), Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), and AWS Lambda when a change is made to your S3
resources.
Storage logging and monitoring
Amazon S3 provides logging and monitoring tools that you can use to monitor and control
how your Amazon S3 resources are being used. For more information, see
