perform S3 object operations, such as
GetObject
and
PutObject
. Access points simplify managing data access at scale for
shared datasets in Amazon S3.
Each access point has its own access point policy. You can configure
Block Public Access
settings
for each access point attached to a bucket. To restrict Amazon S3 data access to a private network, you can
also configure any access point to accept requests only from a virtual private cloud
(VPC).
