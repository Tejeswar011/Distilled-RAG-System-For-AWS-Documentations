object
is a file and any metadata that describes
the file. A
bucket
is a container for objects.
To store your data in Amazon S3, you first create a bucket and specify a bucket name and
AWS Region. Then, you upload your data to that bucket as objects in Amazon S3. Each object
has a

bucket.
S3 provides features that you can configure to support your specific use case. For
example, you can use S3 Versioning to keep multiple versions of an object in the same
bucket, which allows you to restore objects that are accidentally deleted or
overwritten.
Buckets and the objects in them are private and can be accessed only if you explicitly
