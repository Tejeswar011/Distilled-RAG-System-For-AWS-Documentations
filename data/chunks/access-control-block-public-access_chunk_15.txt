PutAccessPointPolicy
for all of the bucket's
same-account access points if the specified policy allows public access.
Setting this option to
TRUE
for an access point causes Amazon S3 to reject calls to
PutAccessPointPolicy
and
PutBucketPolicy
that are made through the access point if
the specified policy (for either the access point or the underlying bucket)
allows public access.
You can use this setting to allow users to manage access point and bucket
policies without allowing them to publicly share the bucket or the
objects it contains. Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing
access point or bucket policies.
Important
To use this setting effectively, we recommend that you apply
it at the
account
level. A bucket policy
can allow users to alter a bucket's block public access
