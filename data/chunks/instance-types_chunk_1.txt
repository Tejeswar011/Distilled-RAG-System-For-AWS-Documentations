family based on these capabilities. Select an instance type based on the requirements of the
application or software that you plan to run on your instance.
Amazon EC2 dedicates some resources of the host computer, such as CPU, memory, and instance
storage, to a particular instance. Amazon EC2 shares other resources of the host computer, such
as the network and the disk subsystem, among instances. If each instance on a host computer
tries to use as much of one of these shared resources as possible, each receives an equal
share of that resource. However, when a resource is underused, an instance can consume a
higher share of that resource while it's available.
Each instance type provides higher or lower minimum performance from a shared resource.
