Retrieving archived objects
You can set the storage class of an object to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (
GLACIER
) or
S3 Glacier Deep Archive (
DEEP_ARCHIVE
) in the same ways that you do for the other storage classes
as described in the section
Setting the storage class of an object
.
However, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Glacier Deep Archive objects are archived, and not
available for real-time access. For more information, see
Understanding archival storage in S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Glacier Deep Archive
.
Note
When you use S3 Glacier storage classes, your objects remain in Amazon S3. You can't access them directly through the
separate Amazon Glacier service. For information about the Amazon Glacier service, see the
Amazon Glacier Developer Guide
