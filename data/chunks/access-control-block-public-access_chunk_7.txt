Enabling Block Public Access helps protect your resources by preventing public access from
being granted through the resource policies or access control lists (ACLs) that are
directly attached to S3 resources. In addition to enabling Block Public Access,
carefully inspect the following policies to confirm that they don't grant public
access:
Identity-based policies attached to associated AWS principals (for example, IAM roles)
Resource-based policies attached to associated AWS resources (for example, AWS Key Management Service (KMS) keys)
Note
You can enable block public access settings only for organizations, access points, buckets, and
AWS accounts. Amazon S3 doesn't support block public access settings on a
per-object basis.
