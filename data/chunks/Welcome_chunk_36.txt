Regions
You can choose the geographical AWS Region where Amazon S3 stores the buckets that
you create. You might choose a Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or
address regulatory requirements. Objects stored in an AWS Region never leave the
Region unless you explicitly transfer or replicate them to another Region.
For example, objects stored in the Europe (Ireland) Region
never leave it.
Note
You can access Amazon S3 and its features only in the AWS Regions that are
enabled for your account. For more information about enabling a Region to create
and manage AWS resources, see
Managing AWS Regions
in
the
AWS General Reference
