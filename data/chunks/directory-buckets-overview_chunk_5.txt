subsection of your bucket, you can specify a subdirectory path in the
prefix
parameter, for example,
prefix=dir1/
.
Key names
For directory buckets, subdirectories that are common to multiple object keys are
created with the first object key. Additional object keys for the same subdirectory use
the previously created subdirectory. This model gives you flexibility in choosing object
keys that are best suited to the application, with equal support for sparse and dense
directories.
Access management
Directory buckets have all S3 Block Public Access settings enabled by default at the
bucket level. S3 Object Ownership is set to bucket owner enforced and access control
lists (ACLs) are disabled. These settings can't be modified.
