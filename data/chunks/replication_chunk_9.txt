AWS Regions.
Minimize latency
â If your customers are in
two geographic locations, you can minimize latency in accessing objects by maintaining
object copies in AWS Regions that are geographically closer to your users.
Increase operational efficiency
â If you have
compute clusters in two different AWS Regions that analyze the same set of objects, you

Same-Region Replication (SRR) is used to copy objects across Amazon S3 buckets in the same
AWS Region. SRR can help you do the following:
Aggregate logs into a single bucket
â If you
store logs in multiple buckets or across multiple accounts, you can easily replicate logs
