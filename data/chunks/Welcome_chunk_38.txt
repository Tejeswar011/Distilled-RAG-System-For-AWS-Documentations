strongly consistent.
Updates to a single key are atomic. For example, if you make a PUT request to an
existing key from one thread and perform a GET request on the same key from a second
thread concurrently, you will get either the old data or the new data, but never partial
or corrupt data.
Amazon S3 achieves high availability by replicating data across multiple servers within
AWS data centers. If a PUT request is successful, your data is safely stored. Any read
(GET or LIST request) that is initiated following the receipt of a successful PUT
response will return the data written by the PUT request. Here are examples of this
behavior:
A process writes a new object to Amazon S3 and immediately lists keys within its
bucket. The new object appears in the list.
