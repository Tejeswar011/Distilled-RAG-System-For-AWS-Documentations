General purpose buckets
â General purpose buckets are recommended for most use cases and access patterns and are the original S3 bucket type.
A general purpose bucket is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3, and you can store any number of objects in a bucket and across all storage classes (except for
S3 Express One Zone), so you can redundantly store objects across multiple Availability Zones. For more information, see
Creating, configuring, and working with Amazon S3 general purpose buckets
.
Note
By default, all general purpose buckets are private. However, you can grant public access to general purpose buckets.
You can control access to general purpose buckets at the bucket, prefix (folder), or object tag level.
