and they provide the most cost-effective way to run a broad spectrum of general purpose
applications. These instances provide reliable CPU resources to deliver a baseline CPU
performance of 40 percent, which is designed to meet the compute requirements for a
majority of general purpose workloads. When more performance is needed, these instances
provide the ability to exceed the baseline CPU performance and deliver up to 100 percent
CPU performance for 95 percent of the time over a 24-hour window.
Flex instances running at a high CPU utilization that is consistently above the baseline
for long periods of time might see a gradual reduction in the maximum burst CPU throughput.
