How S3 Object Lock works
Locking objects with Object Lock
S3 Object Lock can help prevent Amazon S3 objects from being deleted or overwritten for a
fixed amount of time or indefinitely. Object Lock uses a
write-once-read-many
(WORM) model to store objects. You can use
Object Lock to help meet regulatory requirements that require WORM storage, or to add
another layer of protection against object changes or deletion.
Note
S3 Object Lock has been assessed by Cohasset Associates for use in
environments that are subject to SEC 17a-4, CFTC, and FINRA regulations. For more
