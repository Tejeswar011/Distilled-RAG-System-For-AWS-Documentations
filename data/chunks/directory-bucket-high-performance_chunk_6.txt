You can use many of the same Amazon S3 API operations and features with directory buckets
that you use with general purpose buckets and other storage classes. These include Mountpoint for
Amazon S3, server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), S3 Batch Operations, and S3 Block

AWS SDKs, and the Amazon S3 REST API.
