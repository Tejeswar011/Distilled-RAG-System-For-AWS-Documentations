Introduction
Containers are a key component of modern application development. They are the
standard for organizing compute resources, and managing the content of your application
deployments.
Containers provide a discrete reproducible compute environment for building software
to deploy in the cloud. They also simplify packaging and dependency management. You can
use them for everything from orchestrating web applications or very large multi-cluster
estates to testing your work and doing a proof of concept on your laptop.
This decision guide helps you get started and choose the right AWS container service
for your modern application development.
This 3Â½-minute excerpt is from an 11-minute presentation at re:Invent 2023 by
Umar Saeed, an AWS senior manager and solutions architect. He provides a quick
overview of AWS container choices.
Understand
Containers offer a number of advantages for packaging, deploying, and running
applications:
Portability:
Benefit from a consistent runtime
environment that can run on any platform that supports the container runtime.
Scalability:
Scale applications up or down, based on
demand, with lightweight and easily replicated containers.
Consistency:
Ensure that the application runs the same
way in all environments with a consistent runtime environment.
Efficiency:
Use fewer resources than traditional
virtual machines with lightweight containers.
Isolation:
Improve security and reliability with
containers' process-level isolation, with which applications running in separate containers
cannot interfere with each other, improving security and reliability.
Agility:
Reduce the time that it takes to bring new
features or applications to market by quickly packaging and deploying applications.
You can think about the universe of AWS container services in three distinct
layers:
The
Compute capacity layer
is where your containers
actually run. This layer consists of:
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances:
These instances
provide the underlying compute capacity for running containers. You can choose from a
wide range of instance types and sizes to match your application requirements. EC2
instances can be used as the compute layer for both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS.
AWS Fargate:
Fargate is a serverless compute
engine for containers with which you can run containers without managing the underlying
infrastructure. It removes the need to provision and manage EC2 instances. You can use
Fargate with both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS.
AWS Outposts:
AWS Outposts is a fully managed service that
extends AWS infrastructure and services to your on-premises or hybrid environment.
With AWS Outposts, you can run containers on AWS infrastructure deployed in your own data
center.
The
orchestration layer
schedules and scales your
environment. This layer includes:
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS):
Amazon ECS is a fully managed container
orchestration service that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of
containerized applications. You can use Amazon ECS to define
tasks and services, handle service discovery, and manage the lifecycle of
containers.
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS):
Amazon EKS is a managed Kubernetes
service with which you can deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications using
Kubernetes. It provides a highly available and secure Kubernetes control plane.
Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA):
ROSA is a fully managed
service with which you can deploy and run Red Hat OpenShift clusters on AWS
infrastructure. OpenShift is a popular enterprise-grade Kubernetes platform that extends
the capabilities of Kubernetes with additional features and tools for building,
deploying, and managing containerized applications.
The
Vertical solutions layer
is a set of vertical
integration services that provide higher-level and bundled services that simplify the
process of deploying and managing applications. The AWS services in this layer are:
AWS App Runner:
AWS App Runner is a fully managed service
designed to simplify the deployment and use of containerized web applications and APIs.
You provide your container image, and App Runner automatically builds, deploys, and scales
your application. It handles the provisioning of the underlying compute resources, load
balancing, and automatic scaling based on incoming traffic.
Amazon Lightsail:
Amazon Lightsail is a cloud
platform that offers pre-configured virtual private servers (instances) and other
resources for running applications. It provides pre-defined configurations for quickly
provisioning compute instances, databases, storage, and networking resources.
Lightsail supports running containerized applications by provisioning instances with
Docker pre-installed, aimed at easing the deployment and management of your
containers.
AWS Batch:
AWS Batch is a fully managed service
with which you can run batch computing workloads on AWS. It dynamically provisions the
optimal compute resources based on the volume and specific resource requirements of the
batch jobs that you submit. It automatically handles job scheduling, resource
provisioning, and scaling based on the workload requirements.
Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR):
Amazon ECR is a fully managed
container registry with which you can store, manage, and deploy container images.
It is designed to provide secure and scalable storage for your container images and
simplify provisioning containers with the desired images.
Note
AWS provides a variety of ways to deploy and run containers. One of the first
considerations is your preference for either a serverless operational model or a Kubernetes
operation model. In practice, most customers use both to varying degrees.
The choice of operating model is explored in-depth in the
Choosing a
modern application strategy decision guide
, which is a useful resource for anyone
who wants to explore this question further. In addition, the
Containers and Serverless Recommendation
Guide
takes you through the choices to make when choosing your operating
model.
Consider
It's important to choose a container service that aligns to your application requirements
and operational preferences. The following section outlines some of the key criteria to consider
when choosing a container service, as well as supporting tools and services.
Managed service and operation overhead
Organizations might choose to build on managed container services to reduce their
operational overhead. This approach allows developers and operators to focus on their
unique activities that add value, instead of on undiï¬erentiated tasks.
Workload characteristics
Understanding your workload patterns can help you make architecture choices. Workload
patterns can include web applications, API-based microservices, event-driven applications,
streaming and messaging, data pipelines, IT automations, and more. Some workloads perform
better or are more cost effective in one compute environment versus another type.
Application portability
Many customers want to ensure that their applications can run inâand be migrated or
moved toâa different environment. It's important for them to be able to preserve choice,
or run an application both on premises and in the cloud.
We recommend building competency in software architectures and build packaging with
which you can readily port differentiating business logic between compute services.
Applications built using some technologies might run more effectively on some compute
services rather than others.
Organization size and skills
The skills of your organization are a major factor when deciding which container
services you use. The approach you take can require some investment in DevOps and Site
Reliability Engineer (SRE) teams. Building out an automated pipeline to deploy
applications is common for most modern application development.
Some choices elevate the amount of management you need to do. For example, some
organizations have skills and resources to run and manage a Kubernetes implementation,
because they invest in strong SRE teams to manage Kubernetes clusters and find value in
the associated skill portability. These teams handle frequent cluster upgrades. For
example, Kubernetes has three major releases a year, and deprecates old versions.
Organization size is a key factor, as smaller organizations might have a more limited
IT team made up of people fulfilling multiple roles, while larger enterprises can support
hundreds of workloads in production at once.
Ease of deployment
Different AWS container services meet unique needs in terms of deployment complexity.
Here's how each service is optimized for its own role:
AWS App Runner
offers the most straightforward path for
you to deploy your application on the internet without managing or customizing the
underlying infrastructure.
Amazon ECS
is a good choice if you need more control
over the network and security configurations without sacrificing scale or
features.
Amazon EKS
provides flexibility and control over
application deployment and orchestration provided by Kubernetes technology.
Choose
Now that you know the criteria by which you are evaluating your container options, you are
ready to choose which AWS container services might be a good fit for your organizational
requirements.
The following table highlights which services are optimized for which circumstances. Use the
table to help determine which container services and tools are.
