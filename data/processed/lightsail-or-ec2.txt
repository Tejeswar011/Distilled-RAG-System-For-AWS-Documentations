Introduction
Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers services that can meet your needs for a cloud platform or compute web service.
Three services that are often considered alongside one another are:
Amazon Lightsail
â a set of core services
designed to help you build websites or web applications. Consider Lightsail if you want a
simple unified platform with a few foundational services, including virtual servers, HTTP
load balancing, managed databases, public container deployment, content delivery network
(CDN), DNS management, and domain registration. Lightsail provides fixed and predictable
monthly pricing.
AWS Elastic Beanstalk
â a
service that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale web
applications and services. It supports several programming
languages such as Python, Java, PHP, Node.js, Ruby, .NET, and
Go. With Elastic Beanstalk, you simply upload your application
code, and AWS handles the underlying infrastructure, including
provisioning resources like Amazon EC2 instances, load balancers, and
databases, as well as auto-scaling and monitoring. It provides
built-in integration with AWS services like RDS, Amazon S3, and
CloudWatch. Elastic Beanstalk offers a balance between control
and automation, giving developers the ability to customize
infrastructure while offloading operational overhead. There is
no additional charge for Elastic Beanstalk. You pay for AWS
resources (e.g. Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon S3 buckets) you create to store
and run your application.
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
â an AWS service that
provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity, with the goal of allowing you to develop,
deploy, and scale applications faster. You can use it to launch as many or as few compute
instances as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. You can also
add capacity by provisioning larger instances (up to hundreds of cores and thousands of GiB
memory) or load balancing clusters of smaller instances. Several different pricing models
are available depending on your requirements.
When choosing between Lightsail, Elastic Beanstalk, and Amazon EC2, keep in mind the future growth of your
workload and how you intend to grow your AWS environment. If your future deployment requires
advanced networking or integration with AWS services such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon DynamoDB, or
AWS Lambda, you should strongly consider using Amazon EC2.
Here's a high-level view of the key differences between these services to get you started.

Details on the differences
Explore differences between Lightsail, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and Amazon EC2 in six areas. These cover ease of use, compute and block storage, container deployments,
load balancing, content delivery network, and managed database support.
Ease of use
Ease of use
Lightsail offers a set of core services to deploy web servers and database backed
applications, with support for load balancing, containers, content delivery network (CDN),
DNS management, and domain registration. You can also choose from a set of application
blueprints to deploy standard applications such as a WordPress site, or LAMP stack
application. Lightsail is a good fit for organizations with simple website and
application requirements, and those who prefer fixed, predictable monthly pricing.
Elastic Beanstalk, on the other hand, is a more flexible service
for deploying and scaling web applications. It supports multiple
programming languages and web servers, automatically handles
capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and
application health monitoring. Elastic Beanstalk integrates
seamlessly with other AWS services like RDS and CloudWatch,
allowing for more complex architectures and fine-grained control
over the underlying resources.
With Amazon EC2, you have greater flexibility to configure workloads over a broader set of compute
capacities, features, and integrations with other AWS services. Amazon EC2 provides more flexible purchase
options including on-demand hourly and lower commit-based pricing. A typical deployment of Amazon EC2 may
require the use of other AWS services, such as databases and load balancers, that each have their
own pricing models and configuration details.
Compute and block storage
Compute and block storage
Lightsail provides multiple options for your instance size, ranging from 2 vCPUs,
512 MiB memory, and 20 GB of SSD storage, up to 64 vCPUs, 256 GiB of memory, and 1280 GB of
SSD storage. Lightsail compute instances also include a generous free data transfer
allocation, and are billed with fixed, predictable pricing.
Elastic Beanstalk and Amazon EC2 support hundreds of instance types supporting any workload, with 1 to 100s of vCPUs, and 1000s of
GiB RAM. Multiple individually sized storage volumes can be attached to Elastic Beanstalk and Amazon EC2 instances with various
performance tiers. Elastic Beanstalk and Amazon EC2 also both support Spot Instances and Graviton-based instances, allowing cost-efficient scaling and high-performance computing.
Container deployments
Container deployments
Lightsail containers provide a straightforward way to get started deploying public
container images on AWS compute instances, with 0.25 vCPUs and 512 MiB RAM, to 4 vCPUs
and 8 GiB RAM. Every Lightsail container deployment comes with 500 GB of data transfer
for a fixed monthly fee.
Elastic Beanstalk can run individual Docker containers, multiple containers with Docker Compose,
or deploy to Amazon ECS, a fully managed container orchestration service which manages and scales the
Amazon EC2 instances running containers.
Containers can be self-managed on Amazon EC2, or deployed to a fully managed AWS
container service such as Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, App Runner, Elastic Beanstalk, and Lambda. These services support
both public and private images, more flexible hourly or commit-based billing, and greater
vertical and horizontal scaling capabilities.
Load balancing
Load balancing
Lightsail provides a simple HTTP or HTTPS load balancer for low volume web traffic (up to 5 GB and
400k connections per hour). Lightsail load balancers handle certificate management and are available for
a fixed monthly cost.
YouÂ can
enable
load balancing
for your Elastic Beanstalk environment,
which will create
anÂ
Elastic
Load Balancing
Â load balancer dedicated to your
environment. Elastic Beanstalk fully manages this load balancer,
taking care of security settings and of terminating the load
balancer when you terminate your environment.
Alternatively, you can choose to share a load balancer across
several Elastic Beanstalk environments. With a shared load
balancer, you save on operational cost by avoiding a dedicated
load balancer for each environment. Elastic Beanstalk supports
the Classic Load Balancer, the Application Load Balancer, and
the Network Application Load Balancer types.
Amazon EC2 Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) offers a broader and more scalable range of load balancer options using more flexible
on demand or commit pricing. Amazon EC2 load balancers support both application (HTTP, HTTPS, WebSockets) and
network (TCP, UDP) traffic.
Content delivery network
Content delivery network
To improve web content load time, Lightsail lets you add a content delivery network
(CDN) distribution to your website or application. Lightsail CDN distributions are
available in three monthly data transfer tiers, including 50 GB included for the first
year, 200 GB, and 500 GB, for a fixed monthly price.
After you have created and deployed your Elastic Beanstalk
application you can sign up for CloudFront and start using
CloudFront to distribute your content.
Amazon EC2 and Elastic Load Balancing work directly with the Amazon CloudFront CDN (the same CDN used by
Lightsail). Using CloudFront directly offers more integration possibilities with other
AWS services or external origins. It also offers more flexible on demand and
commit-based pricing than Lightsail.
Managed database support
Managed database support
Lightsail offers managed databases in six standard, and six high availability
configurations, ranging from 1 to 4 processor cores, 1 GiB to 32 GiB RAM, and 40 GB to 960
GB storage. Lightsail databases are billed using a fixed, predictable monthly price.
Elastic Beanstalk provides integration
withÂ
Amazon
Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)
. You can use
Elastic Beanstalk to add a MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or SQL
Server database to an existing environment or a new one when you
create it. When you add a database instance, Elastic Beanstalk
provides the connection information to your application. It does
this by setting the environment properties for the database
hostname, port, user name, password, and database name. You can
also connect to an external database managed outside of Elastic
Beanstalk which allows you to use database types that aren't
supported with integrated databases. This option will require
additional security group and connection string configuration.
Amazon EC2 works directly with Amazon RDS and NoSQL services, such as Amazon DynamoDB. Amazon RDS offers a
more scalable and broader range of configurations, including fixed instance types ranging
from 2 to dozens of vCPUs, and 100s of GiB RAM, unlimited storage, and seamlessly scalable
serverless options.
