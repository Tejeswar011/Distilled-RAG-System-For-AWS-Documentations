Managing the lifecycle of objects
S3 Lifecycle helps you store objects cost effectively throughout their lifecycle by
transitioning them to lower-cost storage classes, or, deleting expired objects on your
behalf. To manage the lifecycle of your objects, create an
S3 Lifecycle
configuration
for your bucket. An S3 Lifecycle configuration is a set of rules
that define actions that Amazon S3 applies to a group of objects. There are two types of
actions:
Transition actions
â These actions define
when objects transition to another storage class. For example, you might choose to
transition objects to the S3 Standard-IA storage class 30 days after creating them,
or archive objects to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class one year after
creating them. For more information, see
Understanding and managing Amazon S3 storage classes
.
There are costs associated with lifecycle transition requests. For pricing
information, see
Amazon S3
pricing
.
Expiration actions
â These actions define
when objects expire. Amazon S3 deletes expired objects on your behalf. For example, you
might to choose to expire objects after they have been stored for a regulatory
compliance period. For more information, see
Expiring objects
.
There are potential costs associated with lifecycle expiration only when you
expire objects in a storage class with a minimum storage duration. For more
information, see
Minimum storage duration
charge
.
Important
General purpose buckets
â You can't use a bucket policy to
prevent deletions or transitions by an S3 Lifecycle rule. For example, even if your
bucket policy denies all actions for all principals, your S3 Lifecycle configuration
still functions as normal.
Existing and new objects
When you add a Lifecycle configuration to a bucket, the configuration rules apply to
both existing objects and objects that you add later. For example, if you add a
Lifecycle configuration rule today with an expiration action that causes objects to
expire 30 days after creation, Amazon S3 will queue for removal any existing objects that are
more than 30 days old.
Changes in billing
If there is any delay between when an object becomes eligible for a lifecycle action
and when Amazon S3 transfers or expires your object, billing changes are applied as soon as
the object becomes eligible for the lifecycle action. For example, if an object is
scheduled to expire and Amazon S3 doesn't immediately expire the object, you won't be charged
for storage after the expiration time.
The one exception to this behavior is if you have a lifecycle rule to transition to the
S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class. In that case, billing changes don't occur until the
object has transitioned to S3 Intelligent-Tiering. For more information about S3 Lifecycle
rules, see
Lifecycle configuration elements
.
Note
There are no data retrieval charges for lifecycle transitions. However, there are
per-request ingestion charges when using
PUT
,
COPY
, or
lifecycle rules to move data into any S3 storage class. Consider the ingestion or
transition cost before moving objects into any storage class. For more information about
cost considerations, see
Amazon S3
pricing
.
Monitoring the effect of lifecycle rules
To monitor the effect of updates made by active lifecycle rules, see
How do I monitor the actions taken by my
lifecycle rules?
.
Managing the complete lifecycle of
objects
With S3 Lifecycle configuration rules you can tell Amazon S3 to transition objects to
less-expensive storage classes, archive or delete them. For example:
If you upload periodic logs to a bucket, your application might need them for
a week or a month. After that, you might want to delete them.
Some documents are frequently accessed for a limited period of time. After
that, they are infrequently accessed. At some point, you might not need
real-time access to them, but your organization or regulations might require you
to archive them for a specific period. After that, you can delete them.
You might upload some types of data to Amazon S3 primarily for archival purposes.
For example, you might archive digital media, financial, and healthcare records,
raw genomics sequence data, long-term database backups, and data that must be
retained for regulatory compliance.
By combining S3 Lifecycle actions to manage an object's complete lifecycle. For
example, suppose that the objects you create have a well-defined lifecycle. Initially,
the objects are frequently accessed for a period of 30 days. Then, objects are
infrequently accessed for up to 90 days. After that, the objects are no longer needed,
so you might choose to archive or delete them.
In this scenario, you can create an S3 Lifecycle rule in which you specify the initial
transition action to S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Standard-IA, or S3 One Zone-IA storage,
another transition action to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage for archiving, and an
expiration action. As you move the objects from one storage class to another, you save
on storage costs. For more information about cost considerations, see
Amazon S3 pricing
