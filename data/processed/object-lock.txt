How S3 Object Lock works
Locking objects with Object Lock
S3 Object Lock can help prevent Amazon S3 objects from being deleted or overwritten for a
fixed amount of time or indefinitely. Object Lock uses a
write-once-read-many
(WORM) model to store objects. You can use
Object Lock to help meet regulatory requirements that require WORM storage, or to add
another layer of protection against object changes or deletion.
Note
S3 Object Lock has been assessed by Cohasset Associates for use in
environments that are subject to SEC 17a-4, CFTC, and FINRA regulations. For more
information about how Object Lock relates to these regulations, see the
Cohasset Associates Compliance Assessment
.
Object Lock provides two ways to manage object retention:
retention periods
and
legal holds
. An
object version can have a retention period, a legal hold, or both.
Retention period
â A retention period
specifies a fixed period of time during which an object version remains locked. You can set
a unique retention period for individual objects. Additionally, you can set a
default retention period on an S3 bucket. You may also restrict the minimum and
maximum allowable retention periods with the
s3:object-lock-remaining-retention-days
condition key in the bucket
policy. This condition key helps you establish the allowable retention period. For more information, see
Setting limits on retention periods with a bucket policy
.
Legal hold
â A legal hold provides the
same protection as a retention period, but it has no expiration date. Instead, a
legal hold remains in place until you explicitly remove it. Legal holds are
independent from retention periods and are placed on individual object
versions.
Object Lock works only in buckets that have S3 Versioning enabled. When you lock an object
version, Amazon S3 stores the lock information in the metadata for that object version. Placing a
retention period or a legal hold on an object protects only the version that's specified in
the request. Retention periods and legal holds don't prevent new versions of the object from
being created, or delete markers to be added on top of the object. For information about
S3 Versioning, see
Retaining multiple versions of objects with S3 Versioning
.
If you put an object into a bucket that already contains an existing protected object with
the same object key name, Amazon S3 creates a new version of that object. The existing protected
version of the object remains locked according to its retention configuration.

Retention periods
A
retention period
protects an object version for a fixed amount
of time. When you place a retention period on an object version, Amazon S3 stores a timestamp
in the object version's metadata to indicate when the retention period expires. After
the retention period expires, the object version can be overwritten or deleted.
You can place a retention period explicitly on an individual object version or on a
bucket's properties so that it applies to all objects in the bucket automatically. When
you apply a retention period to an object version explicitly, you specify a
Retain Until Date
for the object version. Amazon S3 stores this date
in the object version's metadata.
You can also set a retention period in a bucket's properties. When you set a retention
period on a bucket, you specify a duration, in either days or years, for how long to
protect every object version placed in the bucket. When you place an object in the
bucket, Amazon S3 calculates a
Retain Until Date
for the object version
by adding the specified duration to the object version's creation timestamp. The object
version is then protected exactly as though you explicitly placed an individual lock
with that retention period on the object version.
Note
When you
PUT
an object version that has an explicit individual
retention mode and period in a bucket, the object version's individual Object Lock
settings override any bucket property retention settings.
Like all other Object Lock settings, retention periods apply to individual object
versions. Different versions of a single object can have different retention modes and
periods.
For example, suppose that you have an object that is 15 days into a 30-day retention
period, and you
PUT
an object into Amazon S3 with the same name and a 60-day
retention period. In this case, your
PUT
request succeeds, and Amazon S3 creates
a new version of the object with a 60-day retention period. The older version maintains
its original retention period and becomes deletable in 15 days.
After you've applied a retention setting to an object version, you can extend the
retention period. To do this, submit a new Object Lock request for the object version
with a
Retain Until Date
that is later than the one currently
configured for the object version. Amazon S3 replaces the existing retention period with the
new, longer period. Any user with permissions to place an object retention period can
extend a retention period for an object version. To set a retention period, you must
have the
s3:PutObjectRetention
permission.
When you set a retention period on an object or S3 bucket, you must select one of two
retention modes:
compliance
or
governance
.
Retention modes
S3 Object Lock provides two retention modes that apply different levels of
protection to your objects:
Compliance mode
Governance mode
In
compliance
mode, a protected object version can't be
overwritten or deleted by any user, including the root user in your AWS account. When
an object is locked in compliance mode, its retention mode can't be changed, and its
retention period can't be shortened. Compliance mode helps ensure that an object
version can't be overwritten or deleted for the duration of the retention
period.
Note
The only way to delete an object under the compliance mode before its
retention date expires is to delete the associated AWS account.
In
governance
mode, users can't overwrite or delete an object
version or alter its lock settings unless they have special permissions. With
governance mode, you protect objects against being deleted by most users, but you
can still grant some users permission to alter the retention settings or delete the
objects if necessary. You can also use governance mode to test retention-period
settings before creating a compliance-mode retention period.
To override or remove governance-mode retention settings, you must have the
s3:BypassGovernanceRetention
permission and must explicitly include
x-amz-bypass-governance-retention:true
as a request header with any
request that requires overriding governance mode.
Note
By default, the Amazon S3 console includes the
x-amz-bypass-governance-retention:true
header. If you try to
delete objects protected by
governance
mode and have the
s3:BypassGovernanceRetention
permission, the operation will
succeed.
Legal holds
With Object Lock, you can also place a
legal hold
on an object
version. Like a retention period, a legal hold prevents an object version from being
overwritten or deleted. However, a legal hold doesn't have an associated fixed amount of
time and remains in effect until removed. Legal holds can be freely placed and removed
by any user who has the
s3:PutObjectLegalHold
permission.
Legal holds are independent from retention periods. Placing a legal hold on an object
version doesn't affect the retention mode or retention period for that object version.
For example, suppose that you place a legal hold on an object version and that object
version is also protected by a retention period. If the retention period expires, the
object doesn't lose its WORM protection. Rather, the legal hold continues to protect the
object until an authorized user explicitly removes the legal hold. Similarly, if you
remove a legal hold while an object version has a retention period in effect, the object
version remains protected until the retention period expires.
How deletes work with S3 Object Lock
If your bucket has S3 Object Lock enabled and the object is protected by a retention period or
legal hold and you try to delete an object, Amazon S3 returns one of the following responses, depending on
how you tried to delete the object:
Permanent
DELETE
request
â If you issued a
permanent
DELETE
request (a request that specifies a version ID), Amazon S3 returns an
Access Denied (
403 Forbidden
) error when you try to delete the object. For more
information about troubleshooting Access Denied errors with Object Lock, see
S3 Object Lock settings
.
Simple
DELETE
request
â If you issued a
simple
DELETE
request (a request that doesn't specify a version ID), Amazon S3 returns a
200 OK
response and inserts a
delete marker
in
the bucket, and that marker becomes the current version of the object with a new ID. For more
information about managing delete markers with Object Lock, see
Managing delete markers with Object Lock
.
Best practices for using S3 Object Lock
Consider using
Governance mode
if you want to protect objects from being deleted by most
users during a pre-defined retention period, but at the same time want some users with
special permissions to have the flexibility to alter the retention settings or delete the
objects.
Consider using
Compliance mode
if you never want any user, including the root user in your
AWS account, to be able to delete the objects during a pre-defined retention period. You can
use this mode in case you have a requirement to store compliant data.
You can use
Legal Hold
when you are not sure for how long you want your objects to stay
immutable. This could be because you have an upcoming external audit of your data and want
to keep objects immutable till the audit is complete. Alternately, you may have an ongoing
project utilizing a dataset that you want to keep immutable until the project is complete.
Required permissions
Object Lock operations require specific permissions. Depending on the exact operation
that you're attempting, you might need any of the following permissions:
s3:BypassGovernanceRetention
s3:GetBucketObjectLockConfiguration
s3:GetObjectLegalHold
s3:GetObjectRetention
s3:PutBucketObjectLockConfiguration
s3:PutObjectLegalHold
s3:PutObjectRetention
