Understanding and managing Amazon S3 storage classes
Each object in Amazon S3 has a storage class associated with it. By default, objects in S3 are stored in the S3 Standard storage class, however Amazon S3 offers a range of other storage classes for the objects that you store. You choose a class
depending on your use case scenario and performance access requirements. Choosing a storage class designed for your use case lets you optimize storage costs, performance, and availability for your objects. All of these storage classes offer high durability.
The following sections provide details of the various storage classes and how to set the
storage class for your objects.

Storage classes for frequently accessed objects
For performance-sensitive use cases (those that require millisecond access time) and
frequently accessed data, Amazon S3 provides the following storage classes:
S3 Standard
(
STANDARD
) â The default storage class. If you
don't specify the storage class when you upload an object, Amazon S3 assigns the S3 Standard
storage class. To help you optimize costs between S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA you can use
Amazon S3 analytics â Storage Class Analysis
.
S3 Express One Zone
(
EXPRESS_ONEZONE
) â Amazon S3 Express One Zone is a
high-performance, single-zone Amazon S3 storage class that is purpose-built to deliver
consistent, single-digit millisecond data access for your most latency-sensitive
applications. S3 Express One Zone is the lowest latency cloud object storage class available
today, with data access speed up to 10x faster and with request costs 50 percent lower
than S3 Standard. With S3 Express One Zone, your data is redundantly stored on multiple devices
within a single Availability Zone. For more information, see
S3 Express One Zone
.
Reduced Redundancy
Storage
(
REDUCED_REDUNDANCY
) â The Reduced Redundancy
Storage (RRS) class is designed for noncritical, reproducible data that can be
stored with less redundancy than the S3 Standard storage class.
Important
We recommend not using this storage class. The S3 Standard storage class is more
cost-effective.
For durability, RRS objects have an average annual expected loss of 0.01 percent of
objects. If an RRS object is lost, when requests are made to that object, Amazon S3 returns a
405 error.
Storage class for automatically optimizing data with
changing or unknown access patterns
S3 Intelligent-Tiering
(
INTELLIGENT_TIERING
) is an Amazon S3 storage class that's
designed to optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective
access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the
only cloud storage class that delivers automatic cost savings by moving data on a granular
object level between access tiers when access patterns change. S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the
ideal storage class when you want to optimize storage costs for data that has unknown or
changing access patterns. There are no retrieval fees for S3 Intelligent-Tiering.
For a small monthly object monitoring and automation fee, S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitors
access patterns and automatically moves objects that have not been accessed to lower-cost
access tiers. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic storage cost savings in three low-latency
and high-throughput access tiers. For data that can be accessed asynchronously, you can choose
to activate automatic archiving capabilities within the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.
S3 Intelligent-Tiering is designed for 99.9% availability and 99.999999999% durability.
S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically stores objects in three access tiers:
Frequent Access
â Objects that are uploaded or
transitioned to S3 Intelligent-Tiering are automatically stored in the
Frequent Access tier.
Infrequent Access
â S3 Intelligent-Tiering
moves objects that have not been accessed in 30 consecutive days to the
Infrequent Access tier.
Archive Instant Access
â With
S3 Intelligent-Tiering, any existing objects that have not been accessed for 90 consecutive
days are automatically moved to the Archive Instant Access tier.
In addition to these three tiers, S3 Intelligent-Tiering offers two optional archive access
tiers:
Archive Access
â S3 Intelligent-Tiering
provides you with the option to activate the Archive Access tier for data that can be
accessed asynchronously. After activation, the Archive Access tier automatically
archives objects that have not been accessed for a minimum of 90 consecutive days.
Deep Archive Access
â S3 Intelligent-Tiering
provides you with the option to activate the Deep Archive Access tier for data that can be
accessed asynchronously. After activation, the Deep Archive Access tier automatically
archives objects that have not been accessed for a minimum of 180 consecutive days.
Note
Only activate the Archive Access tier for 90 days if you want to bypass the
Archive Instant Access tier. The Archive Access tier delivers slightly lower-cost
storage with minute-to-hour retrieval times. The Archive Instant Access tier delivers millisecond
access and high-throughput performance.
Activate the Archive Access and Deep Archive Access tiers only if your objects can
be accessed asynchronously by your application. If the object that you are retrieving is
stored in the Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers, first restore the object by
using
RestoreObject
.
You can
move newly created data to S3 Intelligent-Tiering
, setting it as your default
storage class. You can also choose to activate one or both of the archive access tiers by
using the
PutBucketIntelligentTieringConfiguration
API operation, the AWS CLI,
or the Amazon S3 console. For more information about using S3 Intelligent-Tiering and activating the
archive access tiers, see
Using S3 Intelligent-Tiering
.
To access objects in the Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers, you first need to restore them. For more information,
see
Restoring objects from the
S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access and Deep Archive Access tiers
.
Note
If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible for
auto-tiering. Smaller objects are always stored in the Frequent Access tier. For more
information about S3 Intelligent-Tiering, see
S3 Intelligent-Tiering access
tiers
.
Storage classes for infrequently accessed
objects
The
S3 Standard-IA
and
S3 One
Zone-IA
storage classes are designed for long-lived and infrequently accessed
data. (IA stands for
infrequent access
.) S3 Standard-IA and S3 One Zone-IA
objects are available for millisecond access (similar to the S3 Standard storage class). Amazon S3
charges a retrieval fee for these objects, so they are most suitable for infrequently accessed
data. For pricing information, see
Amazon S3
pricing
.
For example, you might choose the S3 Standard-IA and S3 One Zone-IA storage classes to do the
following:
For storing backups.
For older data that is accessed infrequently, but that still requires millisecond
access. For example, when you upload data, you might choose the S3 Standard storage class,
and use lifecycle configuration to tell Amazon S3 to transition the objects to the
S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA class.
For more information about lifecycle management, see
Managing the lifecycle of objects
.
Note
The S3 Standard-IA and S3 One Zone-IA storage classes are suitable for objects larger than
128 KB that you plan to store for at least 30 days. If an object is less than 128 KB, Amazon S3
charges you for 128 KB. If you delete an object before the end of the 30-day minimum storage
duration period, you are charged for 30 days.
Objects that are deleted, overwritten, or transitioned to a different storage class before 30 days will incur the normal storage usage charge
plus a pro-rated charge for the remainder of the 30-day minimum. For pricing information, see
Amazon S3 pricing
.
These storage classes differ as follows:
S3 Standard-IA
(
STANDARD_IA
) â Amazon S3 stores the object data
redundantly across multiple geographically separated Availability Zones (similar to the
S3 Standard storage class). S3 Standard-IA objects are resilient to the loss of an
Availability Zone. This storage class offers greater availability and resiliency than the
S3 One Zone-IA class. To help you optimize costs between S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA you can use
Amazon S3 analytics â Storage Class Analysis
S3 One Zone-IA
(
ONEZONE_IA
) â Amazon S3 stores the object data in
only one Availability Zone, which makes it less expensive than S3 Standard-IA. However, the
data is not resilient to the physical loss of the Availability Zone resulting from
disasters, such as earthquakes and floods. The S3 One Zone-IA storage class is as durable as
S3 Standard-IA, but it is less available and less resilient. For a comparison of storage
class durability and availability, see
Comparing the Amazon S3 storage classes
at the end of this section. For pricing information, see
Amazon S3 pricing
. For data residency and isolation use cases, you can
create directory buckets in AWS Local Zones and use the S3 Express One Zone (
EXPRESS_ONEZONE
) and S3 One Zone-IA (
ONEZONE_IA
) storage classes. For more information about
directory buckets in Local Zones, see
Data residency workloads
.
We recommend the following:
S3 Standard-IA
(
STANDARD_IA
) â Use for your primary or only
copy of data that can't be re-created.
S3 One Zone-IA
(
ONEZONE_IA
) â Use if you can re-create the
data if the Availability Zone fails, for object replicas when configuring S3
Cross-Region Replication (CRR). Also, for data residency and isolation, you can create directory buckets in AWS Local Zones and use the S3 One Zone-IA storage class.
Storage classes for rarely accessed objects
The
S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
(
GLACIER_IR
),
S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
(
GLACIER
),
and
S3 Glacier Deep Archive
(
DEEP_ARCHIVE
) storage classes are designed for low-cost, long-term data storage and data archiving. These storage classes require minimum storage durations and retrieval fees making them most effective for rarely accessed data. For more information about S3 Glacier storage classes, see
Understanding S3 Glacier storage classes for long-term data storage
.
Amazon S3 provides the following S3 Glacier storage classes:
S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
(
GLACIER_IR
) â Use for long-term data that's rarely
accessed and requires milliseconds retrieval. Data in this storage class is available for
real-time access.
S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
(
GLACIER
) â Use for archives
where portions of the data might need to be retrieved in minutes. Data in this storage class is archived, and not available for real-time access.
S3 Glacier Deep Archive
(
DEEP_ARCHIVE
) â Use for
archiving data that rarely needs to be accessed. Data in this storage class is archived, and not available for real-time access.
Retrieving archived objects
You can set the storage class of an object to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (
GLACIER
) or
S3 Glacier Deep Archive (
DEEP_ARCHIVE
) in the same ways that you do for the other storage classes
as described in the section
Setting the storage class of an object
.
However, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Glacier Deep Archive objects are archived, and not
available for real-time access. For more information, see
Understanding archival storage in S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Glacier Deep Archive
.
Note
When you use S3 Glacier storage classes, your objects remain in Amazon S3. You can't access them directly through the
separate Amazon Glacier service. For information about the Amazon Glacier service, see the
Amazon Glacier Developer Guide
.
Storage class for Amazon S3 on Outposts
With Amazon S3 on Outposts, you can create S3 buckets on your AWS Outposts resources and store and
retrieve objects on-premises for applications that require local data access, local data
processing, and data residency. You can use the same API operations and features on AWS Outposts as
you do on Amazon S3, including access policies, encryption, and tagging. You can use S3 on Outposts
through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or REST API.
S3 on Outposts provides a new storage class, S3 Outposts (
OUTPOSTS
). The S3
Outposts storage class is available only for objects stored in buckets on Outposts. If you try
to use this storage class with an S3 bucket in an AWS Region, an
InvalidStorageClass
error occurs. In addition, if you try to use other S3
storage classes with objects stored in S3 on Outposts buckets, the same error occurs.
Objects stored in the S3 Outposts (
OUTPOSTS
) storage class are always
encrypted by using server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). For more
information, see
Using server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys
(SSE-S3)
.
You can also explicitly choose to encrypt objects stored in the S3 Outposts storage class
by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C). For more
information, see
Using server-side encryption with
customer-provided keys (SSE-C)
.
Note
S3 on Outposts doesn't support server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys
(SSE-KMS).
For more information about S3 on Outposts, see
What is S3 on Outposts
in the
Amazon S3 on Outposts User Guide
.
