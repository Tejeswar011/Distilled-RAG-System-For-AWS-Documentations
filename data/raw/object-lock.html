            <p><b>Retention period</b> â A retention period
                specifies a fixed period of time during which an object version remains locked. You can set
                a unique retention period for individual objects. Additionally, you can set a
                default retention period on an S3 bucket. You may also restrict the minimum and
                maximum allowable retention periods with the
                    <code class="code">s3:object-lock-remaining-retention-days</code> condition key in the bucket
                policy. This condition key helps you establish the allowable retention period.

        the request. Retention periods and legal holds don't prevent new versions of the object from
        being created, or delete markers to be added on top of the object. For information about

        <h3 id="object-lock-retention-periods">Retention periods</h3>
        <p>A <em>retention period</em> protects an object version for a fixed amount
            of time. When you place a retention period on an object version, Amazon S3 stores a timestamp
            in the object version's metadata to indicate when the retention period expires. After
            the retention period expires, the object version can be overwritten or deleted.</p>
        <p>You can place a retention period explicitly on an individual object version or on a
            bucket's properties so that it applies to all objects in the bucket automatically. When
            you apply a retention period to an object version explicitly, you specify a
                <em>Retain Until Date</em> for the object version. Amazon S3 stores this date
            in the object version's metadata.</p>
        <p>You can also set a retention period in a bucket's properties. When you set a retention
            period on a bucket, you specify a duration, in either days or years, for how long to
            protect every object version placed in the bucket. When you place an object in the
            bucket, Amazon S3 calculates a <em>Retain Until Date</em> for the object version
            by adding the specified duration to the object version's creation timestamp. The object
            version is then protected exactly as though you explicitly placed an individual lock
            with that retention period on the object version.</p>
        <div class="awsdocs-note"><div class="awsdocs-note-title"><awsui-icon name="status-info" variant="link"></awsui-icon><h6>Note</h6></div><div class="awsdocs-note-text"><p>When you <code class="code">PUT</code> an object version that has an explicit individual
                retention mode and period in a bucket, the object version's individual Object Lock
                settings override any bucket property retention settings.</p></div></div>
        <p>Like all other Object Lock settings, retention periods apply to individual object
            versions. Different versions of a single object can have different retention modes and
            periods.</p>
        <p>For example, suppose that you have an object that is 15 days into a 30-day retention
            period, and you <code class="code">PUT</code> an object into Amazon S3 with the same name and a 60-day
            retention period. In this case, your <code class="code">PUT</code> request succeeds, and Amazon S3 creates
            a new version of the object with a 60-day retention period. The older version maintains
            its original retention period and becomes deletable in 15 days.</p>
        <p>After you've applied a retention setting to an object version, you can extend the
            retention period. To do this, submit a new Object Lock request for the object version
            with a <em>Retain Until Date</em> that is later than the one currently
            configured for the object version. Amazon S3 replaces the existing retention period with the
            new, longer period. Any user with permissions to place an object retention period can
            extend a retention period for an object version. To set a retention period, you must
            have the <code class="code">s3:PutObjectRetention</code> permission.</p>
        <p>When you set a retention period on an object or S3 bucket, you must select one of two
            retention modes: <em>compliance</em> or
            <em>governance</em>.</p>
     
     
        <h3 id="object-lock-retention-modes">Retention modes</h3>
        <p>S3 Object Lock provides two retention modes that apply different levels of
            protection to your objects:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
             
             
        <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
                <p>Compliance mode</p>
            </li><li class="listitem">
                <p>Governance mode</p>
            </li></ul></div>
        
            <p>In <em>compliance</em> mode, a protected object version can't be
                overwritten or deleted by any user, including the root user in your AWS account. When
                an object is locked in compliance mode, its retention mode can't be changed, and its
                retention period can't be shortened. Compliance mode helps ensure that an object
                version can't be overwritten or deleted for the duration of the retention
                period.</p>
            <div class="awsdocs-note"><div class="awsdocs-note-title"><awsui-icon name="status-info" variant="link"></awsui-icon><h6>Note</h6></div><div class="awsdocs-note-text"><p>The only way to delete an object under the compliance mode before its
                    retention date expires is to delete the associated AWS account.</p></div></div>
        
        
            <p>In <em>governance</em> mode, users can't overwrite or delete an object
                version or alter its lock settings unless they have special permissions. With
                governance mode, you protect objects against being deleted by most users, but you
                can still grant some users permission to alter the retention settings or delete the
                objects if necessary. You can also use governance mode to test retention-period
                settings before creating a compliance-mode retention period. </p>
            <p>To override or remove governance-mode retention settings, you must have the
                    <code class="code">s3:BypassGovernanceRetention</code> permission and must explicitly include
                    <code class="code">x-amz-bypass-governance-retention:true</code> as a request header with any
                request that requires overriding governance mode. </p>
            <div class="awsdocs-note"><div class="awsdocs-note-title"><awsui-icon name="status-info" variant="link"></awsui-icon><h6>Note</h6></div><div class="awsdocs-note-text"><p>By default, the Amazon S3 console includes the
                        <code class="code">x-amz-bypass-governance-retention:true</code> header. If you try to
                    delete objects protected by <em>governance</em> mode and have the
                        <code class="code">s3:BypassGovernanceRetention</code> permission, the operation will
                    succeed. </p></div></div>
        
     
     
        <h3 id="object-lock-legal-holds">Legal holds</h3>
        <p>With Object Lock, you can also place a <em>legal hold</em> on an object
            version. Like a retention period, a legal hold prevents an object version from being
            overwritten or deleted. However, a legal hold doesn't have an associated fixed amount of
            time and remains in effect until removed. Legal holds can be freely placed and removed
            by any user who has the <code class="code">s3:PutObjectLegalHold</code> permission. </p>
        <p>Legal holds are independent from retention periods. Placing a legal hold on an object
            version doesn't affect the retention mode or retention period for that object version. </p>
        <p>For example, suppose that you place a legal hold on an object version and that object
            version is also protected by a retention period. If the retention period expires, the
            object doesn't lose its WORM protection. Rather, the legal hold continues to protect the
            object until an authorized user explicitly removes the legal hold. Similarly, if you
            remove a legal hold while an object version has a retention period in effect, the object
            version remains protected until the retention period expires.</p>
     
   
    <h3 id="object-lock-how-deletes-work">How deletes work with S3 Object Lock</h3>
    <p>If your bucket has S3 Object Lock enabled and the object is protected by a retention period or
      legal hold and you try to delete an object, Amazon S3 returns one of the following responses, depending on
      how you tried to delete the object:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
       
       
    <ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
        <p><b>Permanent <code class="code">DELETE</code> request</b> â If you issued a
          permanent <code class="code">DELETE</code> request (a request that specifies a version ID), Amazon S3 returns an
          Access Denied (<code class="code">403 Forbidden</code>) error when you try to delete the object. For more
          information about troubleshooting Access Denied errors with Object Lock, see <a href="./troubleshoot-403-errors.html#troubleshoot-403-object-lock">S3 Object Lock settings</a>.</p>
      </li><li class="listitem">
        <p><b>Simple <code class="code">DELETE</code> request</b> â If you issued a
          simple <code class="code">DELETE</code> request (a request that doesn't specify a version ID), Amazon S3 returns a
            <code class="code">200 OK</code> response and inserts a <a href="./DeleteMarker.html">delete marker</a> in
          the bucket, and that marker becomes the current version of the object with a new ID. For more
          information about managing delete markers with Object Lock, see <a href="./object-lock-managing.html#object-lock-managing-delete-markers">Managing delete markers with Object Lock</a>.</p>
      </li></ul></div>

   
     
        <h3 id="object-lock-best-practices">Best practices for using S3 Object Lock</h3>
        <p>Consider using <em>Governance mode</em> if you want to protect objects from being deleted by most
            users during a pre-defined retention period, but at the same time want some users with
            special permissions to have the flexibility to alter the retention settings or delete the
            objects. </p>
        <p>Consider using <em>Compliance mode</em> if you never want any user, including the root user in your
            AWS account, to be able to delete the objects during a pre-defined retention period. You can
            use this mode in case you have a requirement to store compliant data. </p>
        <p>You can use <em>Legal Hold</em> when you are not sure for how long you want your objects to stay
            immutable. This could be because you have an upcoming external audit of your data and want
            to keep objects immutable till the audit is complete. Alternately, you may have an ongoing
            project utilizing a dataset that you want to keep immutable until the project is complete.
        </p>
     
     
        <h3 id="object-lock-permissions">Required permissions</h3>
