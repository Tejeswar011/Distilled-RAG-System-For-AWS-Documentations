	<h2 id="s3-express-one-zone">S3 Express One Zone</h2>
	 <p> You can use Amazon S3 Express One Zone for high-performance workloads. S3 Express One Zone is the first S3
		storage class where you can select a single Availability Zone with the option to co-locate
		your object storage with your compute resources which provides the highest possible access
		speed. Objects in S3 Express One Zone are stored in directory buckets located in Availability Zones.
		For more information on directory buckets, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com//AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-buckets-overview.html">Directory
			buckets</a>. </p>
	<p>Amazon S3 Express One Zone is a high-performance, single-zone Amazon S3 storage class that is
		purpose-built to deliver consistent, single-digit millisecond data access for your most
		latency-sensitive applications. S3 Express One Zone is the lowest latency cloud-object storage class
		available today, with data access speeds up to 10x faster and with request costs 50 percent
		lower than S3 Standard. Applications can benefit immediately from requests being completed up
		to an order of magnitude faster. S3 Express One Zone provides similar performance elasticity as
		other S3 storage classes. S3 Express One Zone is used for workloads or performance-critical applications that
		require consistent single-digit millisecond latency. </p>
	<p>As with other Amazon S3 storage classes, you don't need to plan or provision capacity or
		throughput requirements in advance. You can scale your storage up or down, based on need,
		and access your data through the Amazon S3 API.</p>
	
	<p>The Amazon S3 Express One Zone storage class is designed for 99.95 percent availability within a single Availability Zone and is backed
		by the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/sla/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Amazon S3 Service Level Agreement</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>. With
		S3 Express One Zone, your data is redundantly stored on multiple devices within a single
		Availability Zone. S3 Express One Zone is designed to handle concurrent device failures by quickly
		detecting and repairing any lost redundancy. If the existing device encounters a
		failure, S3 Express One Zone automatically shifts requests to new devices within an Availability Zone. 
		This redundancy helps ensure uninterrupted access to your data within an Availability
		Zone.</p>
	<p>S3 Express One Zone is ideal for any application where it's important to minimize the latency
		required to access an object. Such applications can be human-interactive workflows, like
		video editing, where creative professionals need responsive access to content from their
		user interfaces. S3 Express One Zone also benefits analytics and machine learning workloads that
		have similar responsiveness requirements from their data, especially workloads with lots of
		smaller accesses or large numbers of random accesses. S3 Express One Zone can be used with other
		AWS services to support analytics and artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)
		workloads, such as Amazon EMR, Amazon SageMaker AI, and Amazon Athena.</p>

	</div>
	<p>For the directory buckets that use the S3 Express One Zone storage class, data is stored across multiple devices
		within a single Availability Zone but doesn't store data redundantly across Availability
		Zones. When you create a directory bucket to use the S3 Express One Zone storage class, we recommend that you specify an AWS Region and
		an Availability Zone that's local to your Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, or Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) compute instances
		to optimize performance. </p>
	<p>When using S3 Express One Zone, you can interact with your directory bucket in a virtual private cloud (VPC) by
		using a gateway VPC endpoint. With a gateway endpoint, you can access S3 Express One Zone
		directory buckets from your VPC without an internet gateway or NAT device for your VPC,
		and at no additional cost. </p>
	<p>You can use many of the same Amazon S3 API operations and features with directory buckets
		that you use with general purpose buckets and other storage classes. These include Mountpoint for
		Amazon S3, server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), S3 Batch Operations, and S3 Block
		Public Access. You can access S3 Express One Zone by using the Amazon S3 console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI),
		AWS SDKs, and the Amazon S3 REST API.</p>

		<h3 id="s3-express-one-zone-overview">Overview</h3>
		<p>To optimize performance and reduce latency, S3 Express One Zone introduces the following new
			concepts.</p>
		 
			<h4 id="s3-express-overview-az">Availability Zones</h4>
			<p>The Amazon S3 Express One Zone storage class is designed for 99.95 percent availability within a single Availability Zone and is backed
		by the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/sla/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Amazon S3 Service Level Agreement</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>. With
		S3 Express One Zone, your data is redundantly stored on multiple devices within a single
		Availability Zone. S3 Express One Zone is designed to handle concurrent device failures by quickly
		detecting and repairing any lost redundancy. If the existing device encounters a
		failure, S3 Express One Zone automatically shifts requests to new devices within an Availability Zone. 
		This redundancy helps ensure uninterrupted access to your data within an Availability
		Zone.</p>
			<p>An Availability Zone is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power,
				networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region. When you create a directory bucket,
				you choose the Availability Zone and AWS Region where your bucket will be located.
			</p>
			 
				<h5 id="directory-buckets-availability-zone">Single Availability Zone</h5>
				<p>When you create a directory bucket, you choose the Availability Zone and
					AWS Region.</p>
				<p>Directory buckets use the S3 Express One Zone storage class, which is built to be used by
					performance-sensitive applications. S3 Express One Zone is the first S3 storage class where you can select a single Availability Zone with 
the option to co-locate your object storage with your compute resources, which provides the highest possible access speed.</p>
				<p>With
		S3 Express One Zone, your data is redundantly stored on multiple devices within a single
		Availability Zone. S3 Express One Zone is designed for 99.95 percent availability within a single Availability Zone and is backed
		by the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/sla/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Amazon S3 Service Level Agreement</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>. For more information, see <a href="#s3-express-overview-az">Availability Zones</a></p>
			 
		 
		 
			<h4 id="s3-express-overview-endpoints">Endpoints and gateway VPC
					endpoints</h4>
			<p>Bucket-management API operations for directory buckets are available through a
				Regional endpoint and are referred to as Regional endpoint API operations. Examples
				of Regional endpoint API operations are <code class="code">CreateBucket</code> and
					<code class="code">DeleteBucket</code>. After you create a directory bucket, you can use
				Zonal endpoint API operations to upload and manage the objects in your directory
				bucket. Zonal endpoint API operations are available through a Zonal endpoint.
				Examples of Zonal endpoint API operations are <code class="code">PutObject</code> and
					<code class="code">CopyObject</code>.</p>
			<p>You can access S3 Express One Zone from your VPC by using gateway VPC endpoints. After you
				create a gateway endpoint, you can add it as a target in your route table for
				traffic destined from your VPC to S3 Express One Zone. As with Amazon S3, there is no additional
				charge for using gateway endpoints. For more information about how to configure
				gateway VPC endpoints, see <a href="./s3-express-networking.html">Networking for directory buckets</a></p>
		 
		 
			<h4 id="s3-express-overview-authorization">Session-based
					authorization</h4>
			<p>With S3 Express One Zone, you authenticate and authorize requests through a new
				session-based mechanism that is optimized to provide the lowest latency. You can use
					<code class="code">CreateSession</code> to request temporary credentials that provide
				low-latency access to your bucket. These temporary credentials are scoped to a
				specific S3 directory bucket. Session tokens are used only with Zonal (object-level)
				operations (with the exception of <a href="./directory-buckets-objects-copy.html">CopyObject</a>). For more information, see <a href="./s3-express-create-session.html">Authorizing Zonal endpoint API operations with
                CreateSession</a>. </p>
			<p>The <a href="./s3-express-SDKs.html#s3-express-getting-started-accessing-sdks">supported AWS SDKs
					for S3 Express One Zone</a> handle session establishment and refreshment on your
				behalf. To protect your sessions, temporary security
            credentials expire after 5 minutes. After you download and install the AWS SDKs and
				configure the necessary AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions, you can immediately start
				using API operations.</p>
		 
	 
	 
		<h3 id="s3-express-features">Features of S3 Express One Zone</h3>
		<p>The following S3 features are available for S3 Express One Zone. For a complete list of
			supported API operationss and unsupported features, see <a href="./s3-express-differences.html">Differences for directory buckets</a>.</p>
		 
			<h4 id="s3-express-features-access-management">Access management and
					security</h4>
			<p>You can use the following features to audit and manage access. By default, directory
				buckets are private and can be accessed only by users who are explicitly granted
				access. Unlike general purpose buckets, which can set the access control boundary at the
				bucket, prefix, or object tag level, the access control boundary for
				directory buckets is set only at the bucket level. For more information, see <a href="./s3-express-security-iam.html">Authorizing Regional endpoint API operations with IAM</a>. </p>
			<div class="itemizedlist">
				 
				 
				 
				 
				 
			<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
					<p><a href="./access-control-block-public-access.html">S3 Block Public
							Access</a> â All S3 Block Public Access settings are enabled
						by default at the bucket level. This default setting can't be modified.
					</p>
				</li><li class="listitem">
					<p><a href="./about-object-ownership.html">S3 Object Ownership</a> (bucket
						owner enforced by default) â Access control lists (ACLs) are not
						supported for directory buckets. Directory buckets automatically use the
						bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership. Bucket owner enforced
						means that ACLs are disabled, and the bucket owner automatically owns and
						has full control over every object in the bucket. This default setting can't
						be modified. </p>
				</li><li class="listitem">
					<p><a href="./s3-express-security-iam.html">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> â
						IAM helps you securely control access to your directory buckets. You can
						use IAM to grant access to bucket management (Regional) API operations and
						object management (Zonal) API operations through the
							<code class="code">s3express:CreateSession</code> action. For more information, see
							<a href="./s3-express-security-iam.html">Authorizing Regional endpoint API operations with IAM</a>. Unlike object-management
						actions, bucket management actions cannot be cross-account. Only the bucket
						owner can perform those actions.</p>
				</li><li class="listitem">
					<p><a href="./s3-express-security-iam-example-bucket-policies.html">Bucket
							policies</a> â Use IAM-based policy language to configure
						resource-based permissions for your directory buckets. You can also use
						IAM to control access to the <code class="code">CreateSession</code> API operation,
						which allows you to use the Zonal, or object management, API operations. You
						can grant same-account or cross-account access to Zonal API operations. For
						more information about S3 Express One Zone permissions and policies, see <a href="./s3-express-security-iam.html">Authorizing Regional endpoint API operations with IAM</a>.</p>
